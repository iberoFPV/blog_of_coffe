Coffee Blog Project: Learning Programming with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript ☕📚🖥️

This project is a coffee blog created with the purpose of learning programming using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript in a self-taught manner. In this project, we will explore how these technologies have been used to develop
an interactive blog that includes links to coffee-related courses, information about us, and a contact form implemented with JavaScript.

Our website is hosted on the Netlify hosting platform. Thanks to Netlify, we can showcase all the work done. The website can be accessed through the following link: https://fabulous-dodol-a2e562.netlify.app/ 🌐

Technologies Used 💻

The Coffee Blog project has been developed using the following technologies:

HTML5: HTML5 has been used to structure and organize the content of the website. Semantic elements have been created to present information in a clear and accessible manner.

CSS: CSS has been employed to style and design the coffee blog. CSS style rules have been used to customize the visual appearance of the project, including colors, fonts, margins, and other visual aspects.

JavaScript: JavaScript has been used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the project. JavaScript has been implemented to handle the contact form, validate fields, and send the user-entered information. 💡💻🔧
